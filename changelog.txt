**Changes:**

- Added missing recipes for new wood blocks.
- Made the new logs strippable.
- New cauldron model courtesy of @feranogame , though only one variant of it is added in this version.
- Fixed fabric mixin refmap crash.
- Fixed the elusive particle registry crash. Still no idea how this fix did anything but it did.
