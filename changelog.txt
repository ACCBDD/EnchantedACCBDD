VERY IMPORTANT NOTES. VERY.
- JEI integration is disabled in this beta, it'll come back for the full release.
- THIS IS A TESTING BUILD. I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING IT IN A MODPACK.

- ADDED: Command rites (see docs)

- REMOVED: Rite of Blooded Waystone (Duplicate, Charged). It really wasn't fair to be able to make infinite blooded waystones of somebody.

- CHANGED: Re-added missing circle magic.
- CHANGED: SIGNIFICANT rewrites to the Rites API.
- CHANGED: Bound waystones now show their bound location in their tooltip.
- CHANGED: Made curse whispering significantly quieter.
- CHANGED: Reduced the amount of charcoal generated by the rite of broiling.
- CHANGED: Particles now run on a custom shader.
- CHANGED: Rite of Protection barriers now decay over time if the rite isn't active (in case you crash).
- CHANGED: Adjusted item name colours and rarities.
- CHANGED: Made the Blood Poppy's texture slightly less conspicious.
- CHANGED: Rite of Transpose Iron now uses the enchanted:tranpose_iron tag and respects loot tables.

- FIXED: Circle magic rites can run without power if you destroy the gold chalk.
- FIXED: Dismissing a familiar doesn't save it's NBT data.
